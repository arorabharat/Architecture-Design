Offset = 2 bits
Index = 4 bits
Tag = 26 bits

Cache size = 512B

Way prediction size = 4 bits


Control Circuit Design: Silpa Soni (20%)

Cache Design and Implementation: Bharat Arora (20%) and Vadaga Ananyo Rao (20%)

Datapath Design and Implementation: Sri Harish G  (20%) and Surya Pratap Mehra (20%)

Our datapath and Cache modules are working independently. Testbenches for their indivitual working have been included.
However, the complete integrated circuit is not giving the desired output.
